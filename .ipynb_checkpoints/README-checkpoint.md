📊 Dataset

This project uses the Inside Airbnb public dataset, specifically the listings.csv file which contains metadata on Airbnb properties in various cities.

Sample columns include:
- id, name, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, room_type, number_of_reviews, host_location, etc.

> Note: The dataset is too large to upload — instructions to download it are included in the data/README.md.

> 🧠 This project was inspired by the Zero to Mastery Data Engineering Bootcamp, as part of my learning journey into data engineering and PySpark.
